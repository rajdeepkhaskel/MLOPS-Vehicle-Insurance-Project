2. Write the code on setup.py and pyproject.toml file to import local packages

        conda create -n vehicle python=3.12 -y
        conda activate vehicle
        add required modules to requirements.txt
        Do "pip install -r requirements.txt"
   For pip ->
        python -m venv vehicle
        source vehicle/bin/activate
        add required modules to requirements.txt
        Do "pip install -r requirements.txt"
